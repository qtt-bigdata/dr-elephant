<p>Peak Unified Memory Heuristic identifies and flags jobs which have over allocated Unified Memory region.</p>
<h4>Peak Unified Memory</h4>
<p>If the job's Peak Unified Memory Consumption is much smaller than the allocated Unified Memory space, then we recommend decreasing the allocated Unified Memory Region for your job.</p>
<h3>Action Items</h3>
<p>The Allocated Unified Memory Region can be reduced in the following ways: </p>
<p>1. If your job's Executor Memory is already low, then reduce <i>spark.memory.fraction</i> which will reduce the amount of space allocated to the Unified Memory Region.</p>
<p>2. If your job's Executor Memory is high, then we recommend reducing the <i>spark.executor.memory</i> itself which will lower the Allocated Unified Memory space.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p><i>spark.memory.fraction</i>: This is the fraction of JVM Used Memory (Executor memory - Reserved memory) dedicated to the unified memory region (execution + storage). It basically partitions user memory from execution and storage memory.</p>
<p> Note: Please note that for calculation purposes Dr. Elephant considers 1024 Bytes in 1 KB whereas the spark history server considers 1000 Bytes. So please don't get confused if you find discrepancy in values from these two places. </p>
