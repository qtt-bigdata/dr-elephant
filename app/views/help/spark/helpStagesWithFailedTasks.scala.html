<p>Tasks (and stages and jobs) can fail if an error occurs while the task is executing.</p>

<p>In Spark, each stage is divided into tasks which run individually. Now a task may fail due to more than one reasons. Out of memory and overhead memory issues are the most common reasons. </p>
<p>Due to errors in tasks, their corresponding stages might also fail. The reasons for tasks failure are analysed and suggestions are given.</p>
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>Failed due to Overhead Memory issues: Please try increasing spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead by 500MB in spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead.</p>
<p>Failed due to OOM: Try increasing spark.executor.memory or decreasing spark.memory.fraction (take a look at unified memory heuristic) or decreasing number of cores.</p>
